# RudderStack Community Office Hours

## Overview
Hello and welcome to the official github repo for our bi-weekly community office hours. In those sessions, we will be covering a few things:
- Introductions and some product updates
- Tech talk/demo: Here we will explore a RudderStack feature and go over some questions and use cases (topic TBD and will be based on community feedback)
- Q&A/Feedback: Ask us anything related to RudderStack and also feel free to share any feedback you have. 

We will also share here any demos or code samples that will be discussed during our talks.
